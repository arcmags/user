vim bugs

execute <esc>
-------------

Not entirely certain this is a bug; the following should act the same::

    execute "normal! \<Esc>"
    execute 'normal! \<Esc>'

When run inside a function called while in visual mode, the first command above
exits visual mode as expected, the command does not.

numbers in listed help buffers
------------------------------

If numbers are set globally, and a listed help buffer has local numbers off,
local numbers for that buffer are reset to on every time the buffer is entered.

How to repeat in ``vim --clean <somefile>``::

   :set number
   :help help
   <c-w>o
   :setlocal buflisted
   :bnext
   :bnext
   :setlocal nonumber
   :bnext
   :bnext

Every time you return to the listed help buffer, numbers are magically
re-enabled. I looked at */usr/share/vim/vim90/ftplugin/help.vim* but nothing
there is turning numbers back on. I looked at all active autocommands and
nothing appeared to be setting line numbers there.

Is this really that big of a deal? I often browse several help files at once
and it's annoying as f##k.
